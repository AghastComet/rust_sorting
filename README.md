# rust_sorting
Several sorting algorithms implemented in Rust as a simple exercise.

I was getting the algorithms from [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Popular_sorting_algorithms).

I do plan on eventually adding more sorting algorithms, but I might never get back to it.

Each algorithm is minimally tested and I make no promises about the accuracy of the results.
